Overview 
Online Notepad is a free browser-based text editor that allows you to create and edit multiple plain-text files in your browser. No registration and login required. It is great for writing quick notes and printing a simple page. What makes it special is the autosave functionality which saves your draft every second. This prevents data loss in case you accidentally close the tab, or the browser window suddenly crashes. The document you're working on will be automatically restored when you visit back, even when you close and reopen your browser. There's also support for saving documents directly to your computer. Online Notepad is packed with core features that your common text editor provides, including undo, redo, copy, cut, paste, find and replace, font formatting, character map, insert date and time, emoji list, spell checker, word counter, open and save files, and print page.
